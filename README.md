# Simple form

* 2 fields: from and to
* on click on the labels, the corresponding field gets focus
* one button submits the form
* the other button does not submit the form and it clears it
* both buttons have hover effects (color, bacground changes, cursor)
* cannot submit the form if there is no text entered in the fields

Take a look at the example:

* make it responsive, items stack on top of each other
* improve text readability
